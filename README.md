# Foodsy
## Inspiration
United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated that in 2018, about 63 million tons of wasted food were generated in the United States. By donating food, we can  feed people, support local communities, and prevent food from going to waste. 

Thus, there is a need for a food bank that can gather donated food and distribute food to people in need. Further, the site should be the place for people who want to help others volunteer and do good deeds. This is the reason why we built FoodSy. A site that offers donated food to people in need and let others volunteer. We also have senior box program to deliver food to elders at their doors. 

## What it does
- Welcome to FoodSy. First you need to log in to your account, putting in your email and password. You can go back to the homepage after signing in.
- Our mission is to distributes food and other needed essentials to people in need. We have services such as "Donate funds or food for homeless people and the poor", "volunteer in group or individual and join multiple food charity events", "Food delivery program for senior elders", and "help for people in need".
- We have a scan food bar code service to help people scan food and donate food faster. People can contact us by text this phone number for immediate response. 
- We have a chatbot called Foodsy that was built by Google Cloud. Foodsy likes spaghetti and has a spaghetti cooking playlist that she can share in the chat.  Foodsy can also guide people who want to donate food or volunteer. 
- For the backend, we use Linode to host our site.

## How we built it
- Backend: Linode
- Auth0
- Twilio
- Google Cloud
- Frontend: HTML
- Frontend: CSS
- Frontend: JS
- Python

## Use of Linode
We used Linode for the backend of the page. After using Linode, we discovered that Linode has powerful resources for data storage and processing, Linode is easy to use. We want to explore more functions of Linode in our future projects and discover more benefits that Linode can bring to us. 

## Use of Auth0
Auth0 is a great and secure tool to protect users and the authorization. Auth0 is helpful and is a great tool that we like using. 

## Use of Twilio
We use Twilio to set up the automated phone message which is good to assist anyone who is in need of our assistance and want to contact us. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to work with auth0 for the first time and connected everything. At the end, we managed to finish our project which is great. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to set up the authorization process through Auth0 and use Linode as backend. 

## What we learned
We learnt to work with Auth0.
